# Part 3: Authentication with Kerberos

## Overview

Part 3 introduces Kerberos for enhanced authentication security. The tasks involve installing and configuring a dedicated Kerberos server, adding principals and password policies for users, and selecting one of the services (OpenLDAP, SSH, Apache, or OpenVPN) for Kerberos integration, providing an additional layer of authentication.
This repository provides a set of scripts to guide you through configuring a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) and OpenSSH server on Debian-based machines. The scripts cover the setup of both the Kerberos server (Section 1) and the Kerberos client with OpenSSH (Section 2).


### [Section 1: Kerberos Server Configuration](section1/_section1.md)

This section is focused on installing and configuring a Kerberos server. Tasks include setting up the server, adding principals, and defining password policies for users.

### [Section 2: Kerberos Client and OpenSSH Configuration](section2/_section2.md)

The second section involves configuring the kerberos client with OpenSSH.
