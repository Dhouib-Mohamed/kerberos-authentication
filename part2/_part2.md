# Part 2: Management of Network Services with DNS

## Overview

Part 2 of the project focuses on configuring and validating the Domain Name System (DNS) to efficiently manage network services. The tasks involve setting up a separate DNS server (Bind) for domain resolution and adding DNS records for OpenLDAP, Apache, and OpenVPN servers to ensure seamless name-to-IP address translation.

### Section 1: Configuration of a DNS Server

This section is dedicated to configuring a DNS server (Bind) on a distinct machine. Tasks include setting up the server and adding the necessary DNS records for the OpenLDAP, Apache, and OpenVPN servers.

### Section 2: Validation and Testing

The second section focuses on testing DNS resolution for each configured service. Tasks include validating the DNS resolution for the configured services and ensuring correct name-to-IP address translation.
